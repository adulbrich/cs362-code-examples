# Test-Driven Development (TDD)

In this lecture, we use TDD to implement the ROT13 algorithm.

We first define and list expected behaviors for our algorithm.

We then apply our TDD cycle:

1. Pick simplest behavior and write a test for it. The test will fail.
2. Write the minimum amount of code to make the test pass.
3. Refactor the code.

Repeat.

We already provide a `package.json` configured for ESM and Vitest.

You can install dependencies with:

```sh
npm install
```

Switch to the `tests` branch to see the final test suite and implemented algorithm.
