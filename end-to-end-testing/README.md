# End-to-End (E2E) Testing

In this lecture, we cover end-to-end testing using Playwright.

We will work on a [simple todo app](https://github.com/adulbrich/local-todo-app) that uses local storage to manage our todo items.

To start, you should clone the repository:

```sh
git clone https://github.com/adulbrich/local-todo-app.git
```

Follow the instructions in the newly cloned repository's `README` to install dependencies and run the app.

You'll need to install additional dependencies in order to implement the tests.

Switch to the `tests` branch to see the final test suite.
