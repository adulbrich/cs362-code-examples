# Unit Testing

In this lecture, we cover the basics of unit testing using Vitest.

We have the following files:

- `package.json` that is configured for ES modules and will hold our dependencies and scripts
- `sum.js` implements a `sum()` function and exports it using ESM syntax
- `calculator.js` implements a `Calculator` class and exports it using ESM syntax

We first implement a naive test using an `if` statement for our `sum()` function.

The next step is to install the Vitest test framework and write more comprehensive tests for our `Calculator` class.

Switch to the `tests` branch to see solutions.
